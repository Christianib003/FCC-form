More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:
